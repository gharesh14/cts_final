🏥 AI-Powered Prior Authorization & Appeals Risk Prediction

📌 Overview

This project is an AI-driven prior authorization system designed to streamline medical request approvals, reduce delays, and predict appeal risks when requests are denied.
It combines a rule engine powered by LLMs and machine learning models trained on medical datasets (medications, imaging, procedures, and durable medical equipment).

✨ Features

🔑 Provider & Admin Portals – Separate logins for doctors and administrators.

⚡ Sub-5 second decision processing – Rapid approvals with automated checks.

🧠 Rule Engine (LLM-based) – Applies payer guidelines and medical necessity criteria.

📊 ML Models for Denied Requests – Predicts appeal risk (High / Low) and provides reasoning.

🔄 Integration-ready – Supports HL7 FHIR for EMR interoperability.

🗂 Request History & Logs – Tracks all approvals and denials with transparency.

🛠 Admin Control – Manual override option for admins on complex cases.

🏗 System Architecture

1. Provider Portal

Collects patient information, diagnosis, requested services, and insurance details.

Passes the data to the Rule Engine.

2. Rule Engine

Powered by LLM.

If request is valid → Approved (stored in DB, visible to Admin).

If request is invalid → Sent to ML models.

3. ML Models (Medications, Imaging, Procedures, DME)

Predict Appeal Risk (High / Low).

Provide Reasoning behind the prediction.

4. Admin Portal

Displays both approved and denied requests.

Shows risk level and explanation for denials.

Allows manual decision-making and log tracking.

📊 ML Models

Medication Model – Predicts appeal risk for drug-related authorizations.

Imaging Model – Handles requests for CT, MRI, and radiology services.

Procedure Model – Focuses on surgeries and clinical procedures.

DME Model – Assesses durable medical equipment requests (wheelchairs, oxygen supplies, etc.).

Each model outputs:

Appeal Risk: High / Low

Reasoning: Key factors influencing the decision
